# Genesis Communities CPT plugin

This plugin adds a Community Custom Post Type to a Genesis Child theme, similar to the one in the Winning Agent Pro theme.

## Description

This plugin adds a Community Custom Post Type to a Genesis Child theme, similar to the one in the [Winning Agent Pro theme by Carrie Dils](http://savvyjackiedesigns.com/go/winning-agent-theme). You can change the name of the custom post type and the name of the slug, making this a very versatile plugin. Easily rename it to Portfolio, Projects, Towns, Cities, Neighborhoods, etc. Includes a widget to display your custom post type.
